# H1 OBDEnergy: Making Metrics Meaningful in Eco-driving Feedback

**Abstract:** This paper describes an eco-driving feedback system on a mobile app that induces changes in perception of environmental concepts like carbon emissions, with evidence of effects extending to driver behavior. Based on a review of the current market of eco-feedback devices and apps, we conclude that our system of a custom Android app with an OBD vehicle plugin affords accuracy and usability. The design of a user interface that juxtaposes abstract vs. concrete, familiar vs. unfamiliar, and personal vs. global metrics and iconography is based on theories of pro-environmental behavior change and language and cognition. A recruited fleet of 26 university students, staff, and faculty were queried in surveys before and after using the app for one month. We focus on users’ reported understandings of environmental impacts of driving, in both popular terms of climate change discourse (carbon emissions, carbon footprint) and more concrete terms (impact of single gallon of gas). Before using the app, participants conveyed abstract, global impacts (pollution, global warming). After using the app, participants appeal to concrete reference points with calculations and comparisons (quantifying emissions per gallon of gas and over time). We conclude that our theoretical framework and methodology will be useful in future research on message framing and design of eco-feedback, and that our feedback system represents an effective approach to user-centered technology for sustainability.

##H2 Introduction

This paper is concerned with the promotion of pro-environmental behavior in the context of personal vehicle travel through the provision of feedback on driving behavior. We begin our introduction with an overview of the opportunity personal vehicle travel presents for reductions in fossil fuel use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (hitherto termed carbon emissions) through behavior change (i.e., eco-driving). We then briefly review the technological and psychological mechanisms involved in eco-driving feedback, within which we situate the aims of our study. 
Fuel economy estimates posted on every car sold in the US state the caveat, “Actual results will vary for many reasons, including driving conditions, and how you drive and maintain your vehicle.”  Eco-driving is means of strategically taking advantage of this variability. For example, accelerating smoothly at no more than half throttle, keeping an even driving pace, and minimizing braking are just a few ways one’s driving style can improve fuel economy and reduce concomitant carbon emissions. Ensuring proper vehicle maintenance (e.g., tire inflation), strategic trip planning (e.g., avoiding traffic and chaining trips to multiple destinations while the engine is still warm), and minimizing cargo weight represent a few of the many other opportunities to improve fuel economy and reduce carbon emissions on a trip-by-trip basis or more persistent duration. Estimates of the fuel economy improvements (and carbon emission reductions, since the two are directly correlated) resulting from eco-driving range widely, from 5% to 20% depending on the driving and experimental context [3]. Conversely, if one were to neglect all these eco-driving practices, fuel economy could be diminished up to 45% (and carbon emissions increased to a corresponding degree; [4]).


### H3 1.1 Eco-driving Feedback: The Technology
By far, the most prominent strategy used to promote eco-driving is feedback. In-vehicle feedback displays are becoming more prevalent and increasing in variety (see Figures 1-3), especially in hybrid (HEVs) and plug-in and electric vehicles (PHEVs). The extent of eco-driving feedback in conventional gas/internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) is typically only a numeric indicator for real-time and/or average fuel economy (Figure 3) and even that is not required of manufacturers. 
Fig. 1 Lincoln MKZ (Hybrid)
 Fig. 2 Honda Assist (Hybrid)
 Fig. 3 Mazda CX-5 (ICEV)
There are also eco-driving feedback systems available after-market (i.e., not installed in vehicle by manufacturer) that consist of devices and/or web or mobile applications. In-vehicle eco-driving feedback systems installed by manufacturers may be more accurate than after-market eco-feedback systems. After-market eco-feedback can be divided into two categories regarding the collection and calculation of data: those that utilize an OBD-II plugin (Generation II OnBoard Diagnostics ports - Gen. I is no longer in manufacture) and those that do not. We presume that systems without an OBD use speed, GPS, or accelerometer data to calculate fuel consumption and/or carbon emissions. According to [1], mobile devices and OBD devices are on par regarding accuracy in collecting speed data. However, with regards to fuel usage calculations, OBDs provide greater accuracy since they collect fuel level, Mass Air Flow, and other data directly from the engine. Feedback based only on factors external to the engine (e.g., GPS, speed, and acceleration) does not account for vehicle weight and size, drive train, throttle position, air pressure, etc. – factors that vary greatly between vehicles and greatly affect fuel economy. For example, such a device could yield similar feedback whether used for a hybrid vehicle, a sports car, or a Hummer if all exhibited similar acceleration patterns.
A search of Android and iOS apps revealed that there are more than 40 eco-driving apps available in iOS and Android app stores combined. Interestingly, 24 of these apps we confirmed to have originated outside the US. This is important because European countries have more vehicles with manual transmissions, thus their feedback systems emphasize gear shift timing and gear selection. Examples of eco-driving systems with and integrated OBD and mobile app include Metromile, Torque, CaroO Pro, and Dash. Mobile eco-driving apps without an OBD include Geco and STReco-driving.

### H3 1.2 Eco-driving Feedback: The Psychology
Research suggests an average savings of 5% in response to eco-driving feedback interventions; however, these savings range greatly--from 0% to 18% according to one review [10]. Some of this variation in effectiveness is undoubtedly due to the extremely wide variation in the feedback provided. In addition to variations in technology and algorithms used to generate feedback, there is immense variability in terms of the information conveyed in feedback and its design features, both of which have significant implications for the ability of feedback to support behavior change through learning and motivation. 
For all types of eco-feedback - “technology that provides feedback on individual or group behaviors with a goal of reducing environmental impact” ([7]; adapted from [5], [6]), including eco-driving feedback, a core challenge to supporting pro-environmental behavior is to present the environmental impacts of behavior in an effective manner. Environmental impacts (e.g., carbon emissions) can be quite abstract because they typically do not entail immediate, tangible, and personal consequences. A major tenet of Schwartz’s Norm Activation Model (NAM) [11] is that proenvironmental behavior is supported by awareness of the consequences (AC) of one’s behavior for others and the environment, as well as a sense of personal responsibility. Schwartz suggests the importance of awareness of concrete consequences: “Persons high in AC are presumed to become aware of extensive and specific consequences. … A person who becomes aware intensely and in detail of how his potential actions may affect others is likely to experience activation of moral norms” (p. 357). 
Presenting environmental impacts in a way that supports awareness of concrete consequences can include quantifications. For example, in scientific and popular discourse concerning climate change, kilograms of CO2 is a common metric to convey environmental impact. Of the 40+ eco-driving apps available on Android and iOS platforms, 11 report carbon emissions, typically in kilograms (e.g., Figures 4 and 6). Whether or not such a specific, quantified consequence is meaningful is a separate issue but also related to the idea of concrete consequences--concrete in the sense of tangible and familiar; for example, icons of clouds (Figure 4) or power plants (Figure 5) are sometimes paired with quantifications of carbon. In yet another sense, concrete consequences might be those that are personal and have an emotional impact; emotional imagery involving plants and animals (e.g., Figure 1) is often used in eco-driving feedback to convey less familiar and less personal environmental impacts.

Fig. 7 CaroO Pro
Relational Frame Theory (RFT) [9] is a behavior analytic theory of language and cognition that is applicable to this predicament of fostering awareness of concrete consequences via eco-feedback. This theory focuses on the phenomenon of framing events relationally, which means responding to (i.e., thinking about or speaking about) some event in terms of another (termed a relational frame). For example, relational frames of coordination are based on identity or similarity and establish equivalence classes (e.g., fuel combusted equates to carbon emitted). Comparative relational frames are involved “whenever one event is responded to in terms of a quantitative or qualitative relation along a specified dimension with another event” (p. 36; e.g., one gallon of gas weighs less than the carbon emissions from its combustion). Temporal relations are a special case of comparative frames whereby someone thinks or speaks about an event in terms of its relationship to time.
Every relational frame can be characterized in terms of three general properties [9]. Mutual entailment means that the relation between two events is mutual; for example, one might understand fuel consumed in terms of carbon emissions and vice versa. Combinatorial entailment extends this principle to mutually related events; for example, trees are required to offset carbon emissions and carbon emissions equates to fuel combusted, therefore trees are required to offset fuel combusted. Finally, transformation of stimulus functions refers to a change in the functions of a stimulus as a result of its relation to another stimulus; for example, if trees required to offset carbon emissions evokes an emotional response and motivation to reduce energy use, carbon emissions should take on that evocative effect as a result of a relational frame of coordination between trees required and carbon emissions.
As clearly seen in Figures 5, 6, and 8, existing eco-driving mobile apps are operating with implicit assumptions that align with RFT. Multiple metrics, concrete and abstract, are juxtaposed and creatively visualized to increase awareness of consequences through relational responding. Specifically, they promote an understanding of carbon emissions based on its relation to fuel consumed, cost, and driving distance (and vice versa).

### H3 1.3 Present Research

The present research concerns the design, programming, and user testing of an integrated mobile app and OBD eco-driving feedback system called OBDEnergy. The focus is on an analysis of user testing based on principles of RFT and the Norm Activation Model of pro-environmental behavior. We hypothesized that OBDEnergy would promote relational responding among users in terms of their understanding of environmental impact (AC) related to their personal vehicle travel. Specifically, we hypothesized that users’ awareness of consequences would become more concrete as a result of relational frames that involve specific, tangible, familiar, and personal metrics. To the degree that OBDEnergy enhances awareness of concrete consequences and makes salient drivers’ personal responsibility, we also anticipated some effect on behavioral intentions.
## H2 2. Method 

### H3 2.1 OBDEnergy
This paper focuses on a behavioral study that was part of a larger project involving the design of a software and hardware feedback system capable of providing drivers with accurate information related to their personal vehicle fuel consumption. An Android application was programmed to communicate with vehicle engines via a Bluetooth enabled OBD-II plug-in device. We chose to use a mobile phone instead of an independent dashboard-mounted device, which would have stayed in the car, for several reasons. First, accessibility and convenience; it avoids the problem of procuring and outfitting each car with extra hardware. More importantly, mobile phones are very personal devices – a person will have access to the app and be able to view their own data any time at their convenience. 

**Hardware:** OBD-II. The OBD-II is a port, usually located underneath the steering wheel, standard for all cars after 1996. The engine sends data from various gauges and sensors to the port; the “data protocol” of the car, set by the manufacturer, specifies which and how many data parameters are sent to the port. One of the most common, used in this study is the ISO-9141 protocol, but data protocols vary by make, model, and even year.
We chose to involve data from the OBD-II port to make our data calculations as accurate as possible. Data is supplied to the port from sensors and gauges within the vehicle itself. The engine is queried constantly throughout a drive for two parameters: Fuel Level and Mass Air Flow. At the end of a drive, a formula for each parameter is used to calculate gallons of gasoline used for that drive; the two numbers are cross-checked. This gallons figure is multiplied by the EPA’s multiplier constant (8.9 kg CO2 per gallon of gas) to estimate the kilograms of carbon generated. 
**Software:** Android. The OBD-II is Bluetooth enabled, allowing it to communicate with mobile devices. The Android platform was selected to complement the OBD-II because the operating system (OS) easily supports Bluetooth functionality. Due to the wide variety of Android versions, hardware, and screen sizes the app had to support, it was programmed to check for platform- or version-specific elements and apply patches in order to run all functionalities seamlessly. Graphics on the screen were programmed to dynamically resize to smaller screens. In addition, task and memory management minimizes workload on the hardware of the phone.
**User Interface:** The UI is separated into three tabs, corresponding to different activities: driving (‘Drive’), viewing feedback at the end of a trip (‘Metrics’), and viewing historical feedback based on driving behavior accumulated over a day, week, or month (‘Graphs’). The screens increase in visual complexity based on the users’ ability to absorb information at that time, from a hands-off interface during driving to a more interactive one in retrospective modes. We limited text in the app to single out the effects of comparative metrics and corresponding imagery.

Fig. 12 'Info' screen explaining metrics and formulas used


The ‘Drive’ screen (Figure 9) process is as follows: connecting to hardware, using onscreen instructions to complete connection, pressing ‘START’ before driving, and pressing ‘STOP’. Pressing ‘STOP’ in ‘Drive’ activates ‘Metrics’ screen(Figure 10) for immediate feedback. The app was designed to require activation in order to promote feedback viewing at the end of a trip. This was based on the assumption that active engagement early on would promote interest and further engagement with the app; without that initiative, viewers might forget to interact with the app altogether.
The ‘Metrics’ screen presents metrics as icons with corresponding figures calculated during the drive. To promote relational frames of abstract and concrete concepts (e.g., kilograms of carbon to gallons of gas), we present each metric adjacent to the other for instant comparison. Metrics displayed to the user were gallons of gasoline, kilograms of carbon emissions, and trees required to offset those carbon emissions. Icons to represent these concepts were a gasoline can, a cloud, and a leaf, respectively. Distance traveled (miles) and average speed per trip (mph) were provided without corresponding icons. ‘Metrics’ can only be viewed at the end of a trip.
The third screen, ‘Graphs’ (Figures 11 and 12), presents the scale of environmental impact accumulated over time in terms of an accumulation of cloud or tree icons – the user must scroll down as the images fill up the screen and beyond. Carbon is represented by clouds; for ‘day’ and ‘week’ time ranges, the screen presents one cloud per kilogram of carbon. For ‘month’, carbon often reached into the hundreds, necessitating a unit change to one cloud per 10 kilograms of carbon. It requires only 0.026 trees to offset 1 kilogram of carbon, therefore clouds accumulated much faster than trees. For greater sensitivity to incremental units of trees required, we visualized trees in terms of accumulations of 10 leaves - one per each tenth of a tree required.


### H3 2.2 Study Design 
Participants recruited to use OBDEnergy completed a paper-based survey before and after a one month experience with the app. All participants were exposed to OBDEnergy and there was no control group. Thus, our study used a within-subjects pre-post test quasi-experimental design. 
We investigated the effects of OBDEnergy in terms of the Norm Activation Model [8] and RFT [9]. Specifically, survey items and analysis focused on the concepts of awareness of concrete consequences and relational frames. Awareness of concrete consequences was gauged by asking participants to describe the environmental impact of one gallon of gas (priming a relational frame between a tangible, familiar metric and a more abstract concept). Similarly, we queried participants regarding their understanding of carbon emissions and their personal energy footprint. 
OBDEnergy does not directly prompt specific changes in driving behavior through real-time feedback with explicit prompts. However, through enhanced awareness of consequences and personal responsibility, we anticipated some indirect effects on behavior. Therefore, the post-test survey included one question about behavior change, inquiring how—if at all—OBDEnergy  had an impact on participants’ overt behavior related to personal vehicle travel.
### H3 2. 3 Participants and Recruitment 
University of California, Davis, students (23), staff (2), and faculty (1) were recruited via listservs administered by campus department coordinators and advisors. Of these 26 participants, 15 are male and 11 are female; they range in age from 19 to 47 years old (M = 25.87 years old, SD = 7.21 years). Inclusion criteria were that the participant be at least 18 years old with a valid California driver’s license, drive at least 20-30 trips per month, and have a personal vehicle that is a 1997 or newer model, either ICEV or hybrid. Participants were given a $30 Visa gift card at the time of post-test survey administration. Two participants dropped out before completing the month of driving and post-test survey; their responses to the pre-test survey were excluded from analyses and they are not included in the sample size total of 26 participants. 

### H3 2.4 Procedure

**OBDEnergy: Installation, Orientation, and Instructions.** Participants were provided with an OBD-II hardware plugin, but used their own Android phone and their own vehicle throughout the study. The lead researcher installed the OBD-II in each participant's vehicle; emailed each participant a link to download the app to their phone; tested the system to ensure valid data communication between the engine, OBD, and app; and oriented participants to the usage of the app. In particular, participants were instructed on (a) how to activate the app at the start of a trip to initiate data collection and (b) how to end data collection at the end of a trip in order to receive feedback. Users were oriented to the ‘Graphs’ screen, informed that they can view it at any time they are not driving, and encouraged to view it often to track their usage.

 Users were informed that technical glitches were possible and encouraged to contact the researcher for assistance if they felt there was a technical problem. They were also aware that the app was updated frequently and that repeated errors would be fixed in each iteration. Functionality remained intact; the upgrades reduced backend inefficiencies and technical issues.
 
Participants were asked to use the system for a minimum of one month. The mean duration was 36 days (minimum: 28; maximum: 42). Post-test survey responses regarding frequency of use corroborated with data uploads to our database, which tracked data from each drive session. 

Survey Administration. Both pre-test and post-test surveys were paper-based and administered in an office building at the University of California, Davis. The pre-test survey consisted of seven open-ended questions, one closed-ended question, and prompts for demographic information, including age, gender, student status, income range, car driven, and phone used; it took approximately 10 minutes to complete. The post-test survey consisted of 12 open-ended questions and one closed-ended question, requiring approximately 20 minutes to complete. The post-test survey inquired about the usability of the feedback system and frequency of app use in addition to the items that form the basis of our analysis.
OBDEnergy does not directly promote behavior change, for example as might real-time feedback with explicit prompts for efficient driving behavior; but to the degree that it enhances awareness of consequences and makes salient drivers’ personal responsibility, we anticipated some indirect effects on behavioral intention or self-reported behavior. Therefore, the post-test survey included one question about behavior change, inquiring how—if at all—experiencing the app had an impact on participants’ behavior. 

## H2 3. Results 

We organize our analysis around four lines of questioning in the surveys that map onto our theoretical model and hypotheses. Three relate to awareness of environmental impact and relational framing, in both general and specific terms (carbon emissions broadly versus kilograms of carbon and one gallon of gas), and in impersonal and personal terms (impact of gas and carbon versus personal footprint). A fourth line of inquiry concerns self-reported change in behavior. Survey responses to these four sets of questions were coded separately according to emergent themes in the data. Each response could yield multiple codes; all 26 participants answered all questions.


### H3 3.1 Impact of one gallon of gas

Before and after using OBDEnergy, participants were prompted to consider the environmental impact of one gallon of gas. In the pre-test survey, 17 of the 26 participants indicated that they did not know and did not venture a guess. Four participants cited general impacts, including mention of smog, pollution, or global warming (e.g., I imagine the carbon entering the atmosphere adds to the global warming problem). Two made a vague normative observation about emission being “bad” (e.g., I just know that carbon emissions are bad, but I am not aware of the specific impacts of a single gallon of gas). Even participants who seemed well-versed in the climate change discourse were unable to specify a concrete impact in relation to this familiar metric: 
No, I have no idea, although I do realize that it’s more polluting than simply releasing the CO2 into the atmosphere when I drive. I’m sensitive to the fact that there is a huge amount of energy that goes into getting the gas out of the earth, processing, packing, and transporting it to the gas station. And then of course there’s all the energy and materials required to build each gas station… So the impact depends on where one draws the life cycle parameters, but I really have no idea what the impact of one gallon of gas used by my car has on the atmosphere.
Five participants implied that they should know or want to know (I would like to see just how much an impact just one gallon has); two of these were inferred by the fact that they qualified their “no” with “honestly”, but others were more explicit (Sadly, I do not know; I unfortunately do not - I routinely dismiss it as negligible). One participant was able to quantify a specific impact of one gallon of gas in a relational frame of coordination, although it was not an environmental impact: 1 gal is about a 1 way trip to work. In sum, the pre-test survey revealed that none of the participants could provide a specific impact of one gallon of gas on the environment.
In the post-test survey, participants described environmental impact in relation to metrics provided in the feedback. Four participants described the impact in terms of the trees (Needs ~1/4 of a tree to offset its carbon emission; I know we don't have nearly enough trees!; Yes...it took a lot of trees to get rid of carbon). Two referenced weight of carbon emissions—neither explicitly in kilograms, however (I'm pretty sure that one gallon of gas releases more weight than the actual gallon of gasoline; For every gallon of gas my car used it generated close to 20 lbs of CO2? More than I anticipated). Six expressed surprise that the impact was greater than anticipated (e.g., It is quite a large impact! I can't imagine it multiplied by all the cars on the road; This app made me realize that all those short distances add up; I can't imagine it multiplied by all the cars on the road). In contrast to the pre-test survey, there was no mention in the post-test surveys of general impacts concerning pollution and global warming.
Just eight participants still reported very little understanding of the impact of a gallon of gas at the end of the study (e.g., I have a vague idea after looking at the app). Of these, four had technical difficulties that prevented them from viewing retrospective feedback and two reported minimal app use (e.g., I don’t think I drove enough to really understand the impact of a single gallon of gas). Some affirmative responses were too vague to interpret (e.g., Now I do, I had almost no idea of the impact before!). One response very clearly affirms our hypothesis regarding increased awareness of consequences: This app just made me more aware of what I'm releasing into the environment. 
### H3 3.2 Carbon Emissions
Participants were asked about their understanding of carbon emissions, the metric of kilograms of carbon, and the environmental impact of carbon emissions. Again, we looked for differences in awareness of specific consequences and relational frames before and after using the app. In the pre-survey, most participants (19) described general impacts (e.g., I know carbon emissions play a role in global warming; Contributes to overall CO2 in the air... and to degradation of the ozone layer), frequently using the terms global warming (6), greenhouse gas (5), ozone (6), and climate (6). Other responses were vague (e.g., Not sure; It adds up; I understand the science) or offered a general normative statement (e.g., Carbon emissions are bad. Beyond that I have very little understanding; I see marketing and advertising about reducing carbon emissions but I am unaware of their impact on the environment). 
Despite the prevalence of climate change language to describe general consequences of carbon emissions (19 participants), 6 of those participants qualified their response to indicate uncertainty or a limited understanding (e.g., [carbon emissions] add up to have an effect on our atmosphere. Specifically, our OZONE?; I know carbon emissions play a role in global warming but it would be great to have the opportunity to learn the specifics of how carbon emissions actually raise the earth's temperature; I would still have to admit to not knowing all that much at all, since this issue is so multi-faceted; Emissions contribute to global warming and thinning of the atmosphere? Is that even right[?] I just know that they are bad and we are always trying to reduce our carbon footprint). Seven participants related carbon to fossil fuels (My understanding is that carbon emissions come from fuel and energy usage?; Carbon as a fuel source isn’t infinite; burning fossil fuels…). Three participants referenced trees but not in terms of negative environmental impact of carbon emissions (Trees take in CO2 and output O2 during photosynthesis; forest loss; cutting down our environment). None quantified the impact of carbon emissions or mentioned a specific carbon metric (e.g., kilograms or pounds).
The post-test survey item asked participants directly about any change in their understanding of kilograms of carbon compared to the beginning of the study. Nine participants related kilograms of carbon to metrics in the feedback in frames of coordination or comparison (trees, gallons of gas, trip distance) and/or time (trip comparison or accumulation across trips). There were six relations to time or distance (It doesn't take a lot of driving to rack up a lot of kg of carbon; I got a much better understanding of how the ways I drive changes the emissions of my car on a drive-by-drive basis; I had a much better understanding of how individual car emissions, when aggregated, could affect the planet). There were two relations to trees (I had no clue of how much is 1 kg. but over time I started comparing "trees required”; It is like using up a lot of trees! It showed me how much carbon I use when I drive compared to using trees). There were three relations to gas: two direct ($4 spent on gas = approx. 9kg of carbon in the atmosphere; I have more of an idea of how gas used compares to CO2 emitted) and one indirect (My vehicle is more inefficient than I thought compared to the start of the study). 
Two participants quantified relations between carbon and other metrics or time (I had generated over 400lbs of CO2 over the month study period; I was driving under 9 kilograms of carbon per day. Being able to quantify my carbon emissions helped gauge the monetary cost of driving as well ($4 spent on gas = approx. 9kg of carbon in the atmosphere). Five participants expressed surprise at the amount of kilograms of carbon their vehicle emitted (e.g., I had assumed that I produce a lot less carbon that I actually do; I had no idea how much carbon my vehicle was emitting and it was a surprise…; I realize that short trips with my car produce more carbon than I thought; … at times it felt like I was killing off a whole forest!; I realized I use more kilograms of carbon than I would think.). Two participants implied that relational frames involving social comparisons in the feedback would increase their understanding of kilograms of carbon (It would be more helpful if I could compare my results with other users or avg American driving similar cars; It would be nice to see how much kg of carbon my car emits relative to other cars). Six participants had technical difficulties and/or low driving frequency so their responses were not applicable and five others reported no change in awareness of kilograms of carbon or their answer revealed misunderstanding (e.g., Trees required to make the gas?). 
### H3 3.3 Energy Footprint
We asked participants to discuss their understanding of their personal energy footprint before and after using the app. All but two participants listed or implied some of their energy-related behaviors, often focusing on energy-responsible behaviors (e.g., I try to bike instead of drive; Reduce energy at home with new windows, unplug unused appliances, and recycle and reuse; I use energy efficient bulbs, try to turn off lights, have solar on my roof). Sixteen of these participants mentioned personal transportation behaviors (e.g., I drive and use energy only when needed; I am conservative with gas too, won't take a long route or drive wastefully all over town; I probably destroy the environment with my driving habits. Deep footprint!). 

Many participants ranked themselves in relation to others (e.g., I would I assert that I am below the average person; maybe slightly less than average), perceived norms (e.g., Medium; Probably quite a bit since I commute a lot; I have a significant footprint; I always figured it to be minimal), or even other time periods (I certainly use much more than I would have if I’d been born 100 years ago!). A few participants also used self-comparison, considering their footprint in terms of different energy-use domains (e.g., Aside from driving to work I am fairly eco-conscious; I don't try to save gasoline so much but I am very conservative with energy in the home). Only one participant provided a quantitative assessment: I recall taking an online carbon footprint/test and the results stated if everyone lived as I did we would need about two earth's worth of resources. A few participants explicitly noted their inability to quantify their footprint (I couldn’t really give an accurate description of my energy usage/carbon footprint, because there’s nothing that measures how much I use; Never tried to measure; I can't quantify my own energy use…), and one participant remarked: I would love to be even better and hopefully this app will know [my footprint] better.

In the post-test survey, twelve participants explicitly reported or clearly implied an increased quantitative understanding of the energy footprint associated with their personal vehicle travel (e.g., I understand the actual amount I conserve every day; I can quantify it now. I'm still not sure of the impact; with the app I was able to see my energy consumption right away. I gained a better idea of what my energy consumption is). Some responses were too vague to ascertain any change as a result of the app (e.g., I could do better). Five participants reported no understanding or a vague understanding of the concept after using the app; of these, three reported technical problems.  

Again, participants described environmental impact in terms of metrics provided in the feedback (trees, gallons of gas, trip distance) and/or time (trip comparison or accumulation across trips) to explain their carbon footprint (e.g., Any gallon of gas still is a big deal, so I think my little usage still hurts the environment a lot, especially over time; I used to think that … I wasn't driving a lot. But this app made me realize that all those short distances add up; I was able to visually see my carbon footprint and that my footprint does add up over time. One participant offered a quantified relational frame: Every 50-60 gallons or so I would need an entire tree to offset my carbon usage. Another recurring theme was that of surprise (e.g., Larger I thought before using the app; My CO2 contributions to the environment are much higher than I thought; My driving consumes more gallons of gas than I thought it did), though this time one participant was surprised by using less than she imagined: I actually realized that I use less than what I thought I did! Two participants made inferences to the population at large based on their feedback: It puts into perspective how much is being let into the atmosphere collectively with all of autos in the world; I'm leaving behind a lot more kg of carbon in the environment because there couldn't possibly be enough trees to get rid of all that was created from my driving plus the rest of the population.

### H3 3.4 Behavior and Intentions
In response to the post-test survey item inquiring after behavior change, as well as in responses to other items, participants did reveal some interesting insights about how the app affected their behavior or intentions. Three themes emerged in the data related to behavior and intentions, though none was present in more than three responses. One reported behavior change was to drive less (i.e., I have already taken steps to drive less; It definitely has taught me to only drive when super necessary; Because of this, I have tried and found a carpool system to reduce my carbon). Another indicated influence over participants’ next vehicle purchase (i.e., “Can't say much, but I look forward to owning an electric or hybrid in the future”; “Although it didn't change my driving habits, it did change my considerations on my next vehicle purchase”). Finally, one participant reflected on goal-setting in relation to the carbon metric in the feedback: [regarding kilograms of carbon:] compared to when I started, it’s now the unit I try to keep down because it’s what I am putting into the world. 

## H2 4. Discussion
### H3 4.1 Relational Framing Increases Awareness of Concrete Environmental Impacts
Several common themes emerged from the pre-test survey data regarding a lack of awareness of concrete consequences. Before using OBDEnergy, participants were unanimously unaware of any concrete environmental impact of one gallon of gas, a highly familiar metric in the context of both driving and energy use discourse. Their explanations of the environmental impact of a gallon of gas and carbon emissions circled abstract (general, global) impacts (climate change, Ozone degradation, and pollution) and norms (“bad”). Regarding their personal carbon footprint related to driving, participants cited travel mode choices, frequency of driving, and driving style; they qualitatively assessed the impact of their behavior (e.g., as minimal, average, or significant), comparing it to some standard. In sum, their awareness of the environmental consequences of their personal vehicle travel was abstract, reflecting general awareness of global impacts and general norms.
The post-test survey data revealed an increase in awareness of concrete consequences after using OBDEnergy. Instead of echoes of scientific explanations and climate change discourse about abstract phenomena, participants’ explanations of environmental impact involved relational frames of coordination and comparison across metrics (carbon, trees, gallons of gas, trip distance) and temporal relations (trip comparison or accumulation across trips). Another pervasive theme that supports the effect of increased awareness of concrete consequences is participants’ surprise upon learning about the carbon emissions that result from their personal vehicle travel.
Although overt change in personal vehicle travel behavior is not the focus of this research nor the direct aim of OBDEnergy, NAM [8] purports that ACs and personal responsibility support pro-environmental behavior. AC was a focus of this research, and we found it was promoted by the feedback system. As a result of highly personalized feedback, we also anticipate that there was an increase in personal responsibility. This is suggested in the survey responses, e.g., those revealing surprise at the environmental impact of one’s own driving behavior. Survey responses related to behavior change support the notion that awareness of concrete consequences and personal responsibility can contribute to overt behavior change in terms of driving style, travel mode choices, and even behavior as significant as vehicle purchase decisions.
### H3 4.2 Meaningful Metrics and Effective Message-Framing
A major goal in the design of OBDEnergy and this study was to promote awareness of concrete environmental consequences of personal vehicle travel through relational frames of coordination, by which participants understand the abstract notion of carbon emissions in terms of tangible and familiar metrics (gallons of gas) and personal and emotional concepts (trees and clouds). Trees and gallons of gas were relatively successful in this respect; participants referenced them in their explanations of the environmental impacts. Notably, a few were confused by the concept of “trees sequestered”. Temporal relations were also apparent as participants calculated and compared metrics across time, often based on the historical comparisons available in the app.
The kilograms of carbon metric itself, however, did not seem to become concrete for users in the sense of adopting it into relational frames of environmental impact. For example, of the three instances where a specific carbon measurement was provided, two translated kilograms (or misinterpreted them) as pounds. Had the carbon metric been pounds instead of, or in addition to, kilograms, we might have seen more quantified relational frames of coordination involving carbon emissions among survey responses. One participant translated gallons of gas into money in a relational frame of coordination. 
### H3 4.3 Limitations and Future Research
Six users reported either infrequent app usage or technical problems. Frequency of usage was not controlled and varied among participants. Future behavioral research with eco-driving apps should include frequency of usage as a moderating variable. Future research with eco-driving apps and OBDs should also take care to ensure uninterrupted and accurate technical performance through rigorous initial setup and pre-testing with each participant as well as regular communication with participants. 
We have just scratched the surface of the opportunity to apply RFT and the concept of awareness of concrete consequences to the field of eco-feedback. Further conceptual work is needed to disentangle the multiple meanings of concrete (specific, local, tangible, familiar, quantifiable, emotional) in the context of eco-feedback and environmental impacts. The theoretical and methodological approach of this study can contribute to the development of standards for effective eco-feedback. For example, further research can systematically investigate the relative effectiveness of different metrics and iconography as measured by relational responding in user reports of their understanding of environmental impacts as well as overt behavior change. 

## H2 5. Conclusions
The automotive and consumer electronics industries are increasingly incorporating information about responsible resource use into commonly used interfaces like vehicle dashboards and thermostats. This represents an industrial, mechanical, and psychological shift toward more responsible energy use, but few standards exist to define and measure critical features and functions of eco-feedback (e.g., how it can make data personal and relevant in a way that supports behavior change). We assert that an important function of eco-feedback is to promote awareness of environmental impacts of behavior in concrete terms. The results of our study illustrate this kind of shift in awareness from abstract to concrete, in accordance with NAM and RFT, and support the contention that such concrete awareness contributes to pro-environmental behavior.
